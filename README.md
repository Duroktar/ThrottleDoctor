## ü©∫ Fine-Tune Your Event Handling!

Welcome to the `Throttle Doctor` Workbench! This interactive demonstration site is your personal sandbox for understanding and experimenting with the core concepts of throttling and debouncing in JavaScript.

Are you tired of guessing how `leading` vs. `trailing` edge executions behave? Do you want to visually grasp the difference between a `throttle` and a `debounce`? This site provides all the "knobs" you need to tweak and observe these powerful optimization techniques in real-time.

## ‚ú® What You Can Do Here

* **Choose Your Treatment**: Select between `Debounce` or `Throttle` modes to see their distinct behaviors.

* **Set the Pulse**: Adjust the `Wait (ms)` time to control the delay or frequency.

* **Edge Control**: Toggle `Leading Edge` and `Trailing Edge` options to precisely manage when your function executes.

* **Live Observation**: Interact with the "Click or hover rapidly here!" area and watch the "Event Log" update instantly, showing you which events trigger a function call and which are gracefully ignored.

## üöÄ How to Use

### Run locally

Simply open `index.html` in your web browser. Use the controls at the top to configure your desired throttling or debouncing behavior, then interact with the designated "Event Area" to see the results reflected in the "Output Log."

### Use Online (recommended)

## üí° Why This Workbench?

Because sometimes, you just need a hands-on approach to master complex timing behaviors. This site is designed to demystify throttling and debouncing, allowing you to visually confirm how each parameter affects function execution.

## üë®‚Äçüî¨ The Library (Coming Soon!)

This workbench is powered by a robust, all-in-one `throttleDebounce` utility. While the full library isn't released yet, this site gives you a sneak peek at its capabilities and allows you to experiment with the common parameters it will offer. Stay tuned for the official release!
